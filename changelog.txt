1.7.1

 * Updated .toc for 4.2

1.7 Basic blacklists and further 4.1 update

 * Option to not randomly summon pets with cooldowns and/or reagent requirements
 * Updated similar pets database with pets added in 4.1 and the Cenarion Hatchling (even though it doesn't include that many existing pets yet.)
 * Changed default behavior to random pet when used without a target
 * Updated the help-me section of config panel; I will be removing this from the curse page because I'm not good at keeping two places updated with the same data
 * Fixed a bug that was causing the database to re-initialize every time CompanionClone was activated
 * Some phrasing changes in messages and help
 * Cleaned up config code some; about section will no longer show incorrect version unless I remember to update that seperately with each version update

1.6.1

 * Updated .toc for 4.1
 * Added space between "CompanionClone" and version number in broker tooltip

1.6: Similar Pets

 * Support for summoning a similar pet when you don't own a pet but do own something similar; currently has data on just a few pet similarities (mini-jousters, all cats and rodents, and robots on a per-model basis.)
 * Config updated to make this optional and to use this as a toggleable action for emotes

1.5.4

 * Fixed bug where keybinding didn't work if set with the blizzard keybindings interface

1.5.3

 * Added support for multiple (arbitrarily many) emotes; one will be chosen at random from those enabled for the current action
 * Emotes moved to their own config page
 * Added !T since %T wasn't working (was it before?  Sorry if I forgot to test that.)
 * Added a test message option for emotes (mainly for my own testing purposes, but I left it in because I imagine some people might want to check that !T, !C work how they think they do, see if they've made typoes, or just play with it without spamming people.)
 * Prints a message instead of throwing an error when you attempt to summon a random pet but have no pets
 * Delayed initialization of pets owned from loading to the first time it's needed; I don't think it really matters perfomance-wise but hopefully this will finally remove those random rare loading issues

1.5.2

 * (Hopefully) better fix for that occasional error on loading
 * Internal re-organization; Companion management code now a separate module

1.5.1

 * Replaces !C in emote/speech text with the name of the companion actually produced
 * Allows emote/text to only happen on some events
 * (Hopefully) fixed bug that occasionally threw an error when loading
 * Fixed a bug that sometimes threw an error when trying to clone a pet that has friends but you don't own any
 * No longer occasionally unsummons current pet when getting a random one (this was due to using the built in random pet function, which does this when it picks the pet you already have out) 

1.5: Emotes

 * Added basic support for emote or speech on cloning
 * Some internal re-organization (Config is a module in its own file now.) 

1.4.1

 * Fixed Bronze Drake
 * Fixed sentence-structure fail in options panel 

1.4: Options

 * Ace integration
 * Option to summon a random pet when you don't have a target or you can't clone your target
 * Option to clone even when you could summon an interacting pet
 * Right clicking the broker plugin will open options panel. A tooltip has been added to the broker plugin to indicate this. 

1.3: Mounts

 * Added mount cloning 

1.2: LibDataBroker and interacting pets

 * Fixed bug that lost your collection data on a reload
 * Added lib data broker support
 * Now fetches interacting pets when possible
 * Removed some hidden files accidentally included in the zip 

1.1.2

 * Show load message only when you load the addon, not every time there's a loading screen 

1.1.1

 * Updates properly when you learn a new pet
 * Load message 

1.1: Keybinding

 * Fixed a bug that prevented proper initializing, causing the addon to act like you didn't own any pets
 * Keybinding option
 * No longer dismisses when you try to clone a pet you have 

1.0: Clone pets

 * Initial release
